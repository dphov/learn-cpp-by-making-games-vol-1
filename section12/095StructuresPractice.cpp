     * CC_UPPER_CASE, CC_LOWER_CASE, and CC_EITHER.
     * Using this enum, modify the GetCharacter function you wrote to modify the input to one of these values depending on the value
     * of the CharacterCaseType (e.g. if it was CC_LOWER_CASE, all input would come out lower case from GetCharacter)
